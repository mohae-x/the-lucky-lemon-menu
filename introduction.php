                            <p> Flynn Citrus, youngest by six and a half minutes, is a talented baker and co-owner of The Lucky Lemon, 
                                who doubles as the smiling face who welcomes each and every customer into their shop. Despite the 
                                overwhelming work that comes with customer service, Flynn doubles as the lead baker, engineering fresh 
                                and exciting recipes every month. 
                                <br> <br> He can often be found in the back room, fussing over freshly baked 
                                pastries and mixing various batters without so much as batting an eye. Get it? Bat-ting an eye? </p>

                                <br> <br> From selecting and juicing lemons by hand, no drink goes without its fair share of love and 
                                care, as it's crafted into a sparkling glass of lemon-flavored perfection. Though the customer doesn't often 
                                see him, any appearance is a welcome one, as it usually comes with a free trial of something new he's whipped up!</p>
